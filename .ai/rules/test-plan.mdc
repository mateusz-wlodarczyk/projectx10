You are an experienced QA engineer tasked with creating a comprehensive test plan for a software development project. Analyze the following project information:

<project_code>
the whole app
</project_code>

<technology_stack>
tech-stack.md
</technology_stack>

Your task is to generate a detailed test plan tailored to the specifics of the project, taking into account the technologies used, code structure, and key elements of the repository. The test plan should be written in English.

Before creating the test plan, conduct a thorough analysis of the project inside the <project_analysis> block in your thought process. The analysis should include:

Key project components based on code analysis:

List and describe the main project components

Specifics of the technology stack and its impact on testing strategy:

Analyze each element of the tech stack and its implications for testing

Testing priorities based on repository structure:

Identify and rank testing areas by importance

Potential risk areas requiring special attention during testing:

List potential risks and justify why they require special attention

After completing the analysis, create the test plan inside the <test_plan> block. The plan should include:

Introduction and testing objectives

Scope of testing

Types of tests to be performed (e.g., unit tests, integration tests, performance tests)

Test scenarios for key functionalities

Test environment

Testing tools

Test schedule

Test acceptance criteria

Roles and responsibilities in the testing process

Bug reporting procedures

Ensure that the test plan is:

Precisely tailored to the project context

Reflective of the technologies used

Prioritizing key repository elements

Written in English

High-quality and professional

Start with the analysis, then proceed to creating the test plan. Your final output should consist only of the test plan and should not replicate or summarize any work done in the project analysis block.
Present the plan in Markdown format.
