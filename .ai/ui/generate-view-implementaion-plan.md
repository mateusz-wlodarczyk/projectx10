Let me conduct a thorough analysis of all the provided information to create a comprehensive implementation plan.

## Step 1: Analyzing Input Sections

### PRD Analysis:

- This is a yacht booking analytics application focused on data visualization and business insights
- Core functionalities: displaying booking data in tables and charts, interactive filtering, drill-down capabilities, exportable reports
- Key user stories: authentication, data recording, filtering, drill-down analysis, export reports, trend evaluation, promotion effectiveness measurement
- Security: user authentication, role-based access control
- Success metrics: 95% data accuracy, 2-second response time for 10k records, 100% successful filtering/drilling

### UI Plan Analysis:

- Analytics Dashboard is the primary view at `/dashboard`
- Main purpose: data visualization and business insights
- Key components: interactive charts, data tables, filter panels, export controls, refresh indicators
- Navigation: primary interface with role-based admin sections
- Mobile-responsive design with progressive disclosure

### API Plan Analysis:

- GET /boats: paginated listing with filtering (page, limit, country, category, region, min_price, max_price, sort, order)
- GET /boats/{slug}: detailed boat information
- GET /boats/search: advanced search with multiple filters
- GET /boats/{slug}/availability: weekly availability data
- GET /boats/{slug}/prices: pricing with date ranges
- Admin endpoints for sync operations and job monitoring
- Authentication via Supabase Auth with role-based access

### Tech Stack Analysis:

- Frontend: Next.js with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- Backend: Node.js with Supabase
- Authentication: Supabase Auth with JWT tokens

## Step 2: Key Requirements Extraction

- Analytics-focused dashboard as primary interface
- Interactive data visualization with charts and tables
- Comprehensive filtering capabilities
- Drill-down functionality from aggregate to detailed data
- Export functionality for reports
- Role-based access control
- Real-time or on-demand data refresh
- Mobile-responsive design
- Performance requirements (2-second response time)

## Step 3: Main Components Needed

1. **DashboardLayout**: Main container with navigation and sidebar
2. **FilterPanel**: Progressive disclosure filter system
3. **AnalyticsCharts**: Interactive charts for trends and comparisons
4. **DataTable**: Sortable, filterable table with drill-down
5. **ExportControls**: Report generation and download management
6. **RefreshIndicator**: Data update status and manual refresh
7. **AdminSection**: Role-based admin functionality
8. **ErrorBoundary**: Comprehensive error handling

## Step 4: Component Tree Diagram

```
DashboardLayout
├── NavigationBar
│   ├── Logo
│   ├── MainNav
│   ├── UserMenu
│   └── AdminMenu (conditional)
├── Sidebar
│   ├── FilterPanel
│   ├── QuickActions
│   └── ExportTools
└── MainContent
    ├── AnalyticsCharts
    ├── DataTable
    ├── RefreshIndicator
    └── AdminSection (conditional)
```

## Step 5: Required DTOs and ViewModels

- **BoatData**: Core boat information from API
- **AnalyticsData**: Aggregated data for charts and tables
- **FilterState**: Current filter configuration
- **ExportOptions**: Export format and data selection
- **UserRole**: Authentication and authorization data
- **SyncStatus**: Admin sync job status

## Step 6: State Variables and Custom Hooks

- **useAnalyticsData**: Data fetching and caching
- **useFilters**: Filter state management
- **useExport**: Export functionality
- **useAuth**: Authentication and role management
- **useSyncStatus**: Admin sync monitoring

## Step 7: API Calls and Frontend Actions

- Fetch boats data with filtering
- Fetch detailed boat information
- Search boats with advanced criteria
- Get availability and pricing data
- Admin sync operations
- Export data processing

## Step 8: User Story Mapping

- US-001 (Authentication): Login form and role-based redirect
- US-005 (Dashboard Data): Charts and tables display
- US-006 (Interactive Filtering): Filter panel implementation
- US-007 (Drill-Down): Click handlers for detailed views
- US-008 (Export Reports): Export controls and functionality
- US-009 (Trends): Chart visualization components
- US-010 (Promotion Effectiveness): Filtering and comparison tools

## Step 9: User Interactions

- Filter application and real-time updates
- Chart/table drill-down navigation
- Export format selection and download
- Manual data refresh
- Admin sync operations
- Mobile responsive interactions

## Step 10: API Conditions and Validation

- Pagination limits (max 100 items per page)
- Date range validation for availability queries
- Role-based endpoint access
- Rate limiting for API calls
- Data format validation

## Step 11: Error Scenarios

- API timeout or failure
- Invalid filter combinations
- Authentication expiration
- Export generation failures
- Sync job errors
- Network connectivity issues

## Step 12: Implementation Challenges

- Complex filter state management
- Real-time data synchronization
- Mobile responsiveness for data tables
- Performance optimization for large datasets
- Role-based UI rendering
- Export functionality complexity

I've created a comprehensive implementation plan for the Analytics Dashboard view. The plan includes detailed component specifications, type definitions, state management strategies, API integration details, and step-by-step implementation guidance. The plan is saved in `.ai/analytics-dashboard-view-implementation-plan.md` and provides everything needed for another frontend developer to implement the view correctly and efficiently.

The implementation plan covers all aspects of the analytics dashboard including:

- Component architecture with clear hierarchies
- Detailed type definitions for all data structures
- Comprehensive state management with custom hooks
- API integration specifications
- User interaction handling
- Error scenarios and validation
- Step-by-step implementation guidance

This plan aligns with the PRD requirements, leverages the available API endpoints, and follows the established tech stack using Next.js, React, TypeScript, and shadcn/ui components.
